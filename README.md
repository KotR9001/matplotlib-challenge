Pharmaceutical Trials

An assignment was conducted to analyze the results of anti-cancer drug trials on mice. Tables and charts were created in Python with Pandas
and MatPlotLib libraries to determine the efficacy of different drug regimens.


The following were made.


-Summary Statistics Table showing the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM tumor volume for each drug regimen.

-Bar Plot to show the number of data points for each treatment regimen.

-Pie Plot to show the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

-Calculation of final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens.

-Box and Whisker Plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens to compare their results and display outliers.

-Line Plot of Time Point vs Tumor Volume for a Mouse.

-Scatter Plot of Mouse Weight vs Average Tumor Volume for one of the Drug Regimens.

-Calculation of the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for one of the
treatment regimens.



The following conclusions were drawn.


1. Capomulin and Ramicane treatments end with mice having the smallest tumor volumes.

2. Mouse b128 generally saw a reduction in tumor volume as time progressed in the study, but this was not uniform, and there could be evidence of a resurgence at the end.

3. The weight vs volume scatterplot, trendline, and R-Squared Value all suggest that there is a strong correlation between the weight of a mouse and the average tumor volume.
